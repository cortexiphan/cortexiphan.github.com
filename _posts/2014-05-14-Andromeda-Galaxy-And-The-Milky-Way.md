  The first time I realized that the Andromeda galaxy is heading towards us is the time I watch the documentary *Wonders of the universe* back in 2011. It said that There was a big-brother galaxy named Andromeda moving to us. However, scientists can only be sure the sight-line speed according to the doppler effect(well most stars in the sky are in red-shift because they're moving away from us, while this guy is heading to us, so it is in amazingly blue-shift), but the side-way speed is never precisely calculated. So, we didn't know whether the two galaxy would collide with each other, or just fly pass this time eventually collide in much much later.

  This problem has haunted scientists for decades. But one day in mid-2012, a big news came out that some scientists in America had finally confirmed that it would be a direct hit, and that would happen in 4 billion years from now! Well, after 4 billion years from now, the Sun would be in its end of Main-Sequence stage, and it would be getting hotter and hotter. At that time, the Earth may not be still able to sustain lift.

  When the two galaxy is merging, the position of our Solar system in the new combined galaxy would be changed, probably get swung further to the outer area of the galaxy, or even get ejected out to the empty space of the longly universe.
